"Is the greatest building more important?" or "Are lower travel costs and a good travel environment much more important?"

Today, I was watching TV, and the news reported that a baby was abused by a nanny. I felt so angry. Why is the nanny so evil? Why do people come to Earth, and for what purpose?
The Earth feels like a prison, where evil people come to torture others. A baby is so small and innocent—why would she do that? I feel so depressed.
The nanny has no humanity. The law is not fair to evil people like this nanny. The punishment for this nanny is too light. I doubt this nanny will ever feel remorseful.
