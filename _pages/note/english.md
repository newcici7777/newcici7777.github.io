When children do something, it is without specific meaning or purpose. They draw pictures when they feel happy, and they write stories when they want to create something. They do these things purely for fun. Making a comic book is just a hobby, and the initial purpose is not for business.

However, when children grow up and become adults, they start considering the benefits and the time cost of everything they do. As adults, they have families to support and need to earn money to raise their children. Food and shelter are not free, so they must think about which jobs can provide a stable income. Career choices become crucial because they impact their entire lives.
